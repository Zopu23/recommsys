Choosing the right machine learning or statistical model for financial applications is often a trial-and-error process, requiring deep domain knowledge and ML expertise. With the rise of diverse model types from
Bayesian inference to LLMs financial analysts, traders, and developers face an overwhelming choice. This leads to misuse of models, wasted resources, or missed opportunities. This project aims to bridge that gap by
classifying and advising on model selection using an intelligent, interactive system, empowering even non-experts to make high-quality data-driven decisions.

: Financial tasks have unique demands like uncertainty management, explainability, data type variety,

and regulatory constraints that current frameworks don't fully address, there is a demand for customized,
structured framework that matches finance-specific use cases (e.g., forecasting, portfolio optimization)

with optimal modeling methods complete with explanations and code delivering tailored advice where it's most
needed.

1. Absence of monitoring tool for LLMs Evolution

Current tools lack systematic, statistical capabilities to effectively track and analyze trends and advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), especially within financial contexts. Although classification of LLMs

exists, there is a significant gap in systematically identifying emerging trends such as the rise of retrieval-augmented models, sparse LLMs, or specialized financial models like BlogmbergGPT. and FinGPT, resulting in
missed strategic insights for investment and research teams.
