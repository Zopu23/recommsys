's on Higgs reheat

In many models of inflation, reheating is realized through a coupling between the inflaton
and the Higgs boson. Often, the mass of the inflaton is of order $10*{13}-8GeV determined
by the amplitude of the scalar fluctuation spectrum. However, in models where the inflaton
potential is of the form $V \sim \phi*k$ about its minimum, the inflaton is massless for $k\ge
48 unless a bare mass term, S\fracl2 m_\phi*2 \phi*2$, is present. In this case, the inflaton
mass may be of order the electroweak scale and may be subject to existing collider
constraints, In particular, we investigate the constraints on the inflaton mass and reheating
temperature $T_{\rm rh}$ arising from the decay of $\phi$ into $\matheal{H}$ through an
interaction term $\mu \phi |\mathcal{H}|*2S. We perform a renormalization group analysis to
determine the relative values of $\mus and $m_\phi$ such that the Higgs potential remains
stable (and perturbative) at high energy. Taking into account the running of the Higgs
quartic self-coupling and the experimental constraints from the LHC via the
S\texttt{HiggsTools}$ public code, we find that $3.4 \times 10°6 $ GeV $\esssim T_{\m
rh)\lesssim 3.9 \times 10*{12) $ GeV with a corresponding constraint on the inflaton bare
mass $260~{\rm GeV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 3.8 \times 10°10}~{\rm GeV}S. The

dependencies between $T_{\rm rh}S and the inflaton bare mass $m_\phi$ as well as
between $\mu$ and $m_\phi$ are provided.

Representation Patterns

ark ~ LLM (latest) «21h ago «Xr

Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for preventing
misuse and building trustworthy Al systems. Although existing detection methods perform
well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (0D) scenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we
hypothesize that, compared to features used by existing detection methods, the internal
representations of LLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more
effectively capture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between LLM-
generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this hypothesis across
different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural activation patterns when
processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we propose RepreGuard, an efficient
statistics-based detection method. Specifically, we first employ a surrogate model to
collect representation of LGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can
better identify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of the text
representations along this feature direction and comparing with a precomputed threshold.
Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms all baselines with average 94.92%
AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD scenarios, while also demonstrating robust
resilience to various text sizes and mainstream attacks. Data and code are publicly available

4DNeX: Feed-Forward 4D Generative Modeling Made Easy

arXiv LLM latest)» 2th ago» Zhaoxi Chen

Read Open

We present 4DNeX, the first feed-forward framework for generating 4D (i.e., dynamic 3D)
scene representations from a single image. In contrast to existing methods that rely on
computationally intensive optimization or require multi-frame video inputs, 4DNeX enables
efficient, end-to-end image-to-4D generation by fine-tuning a pretrained video diffusion
model. Specifically, 1) to alleviate the scarcity of 4D data, we construct 4DNeX-10M, a
large-scale dataset with high-quality 4D annotations generated using advanced
reconstruction approaches, 2) we introduce a unified 6D video representation that jointly
models RGB and XYZ sequences, facilitating structured learning of both appearance and
geometry. 3) we propose a set of simple yet effective adaptation strategies to repurpose
retrained video diffusion models for 4D modeling. 4DNeX produces high-quality dynamic
point clouds that enable novel-view video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that 4DNeX outperforms existing 4D generation methods in efficiency and generalizability,
offering a scalable solution for image-to-4D modeling and laying the foundation for
generative 4D world models that simulate dynamic scene evolution.

Driven-Dissipative Interpretation of Measurement-Induced State
Transitions Beyond Semiclassical Predictions

LLM (latest) - 2th age » Bo-Syun Pan

Read OPO”

Dispersive readout plays a central role in superconducting quantum computing, enabling
quantum nondemalition (QND) measurements of qubits through a coupled microwave
resonator. However, under strong readout drives, multi-photon resonances can cause
measurement-induced state transition (MIST), resulting in qubit leakage out of the
computational subspace and compromising the QND character. We present a driven-
dissipative interpretation of MIST using a reduced quantum model that captures the
dynamics and entanglement structure underlying the breakdown of QND measurement, a
feature inaccessible to previous semiclassical treatments. A super-MIST regime under
strong drive is uncovered, characterized by steady-state qubit inversion and slow relaxation
beyond the semiclassical Landau-Zener predictions. We further identify a transient readout
condition in which the resonator becomes highly populated while the qubit remains near its
original state. These results are broadly applicable to superconducting qubits such as
fluxonium and transmon, unveil the nonequilibrium dynamics of MIST, and highlight strongly
driven regimes that can be leveraged for measurement optimization.
