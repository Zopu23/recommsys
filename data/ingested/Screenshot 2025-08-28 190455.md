1. Absence of monitoring tool for LLMs Evolution

Current tools lack systematic, statistical capabilities to effectively track and analyze trends and advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), especially within financial contexts. Although classification of LLMs

exists, there is a significant gap in systematically identifying emerging trends such as the rise of retrieval-augmented models, sparse LLMs, or specialized financial models like BlogmbergGPT. and FinGPT, resulting in
missed strategic insights for investment and research teams.
