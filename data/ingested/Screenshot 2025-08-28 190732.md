Exp 3: Explainer - Ideas Exploration

Models

Experiment

Translate technical LLM papers and
benchmarks into plain language.
Identify key performance and
architectural features that matter to
financial users.

Test interpretability techniques for
clarity, trust, and explainability.

Data

Model documentation, HuggingFace &
arXiv abstracts, technical blogs.
Financial datasets (e.g. risk reports, call
transcripts) used for evaluation
context.

Human feedback (Likert ratings) on
explanation clarity and usefulness.

OpenAl GPT family, Meta LLaMA, Mistral,

Claude, Gemini (for output comparison).
Explainability models: SHAP, LIME,
Attention Flow.

Concept clustering with BERTopic or
KeyBERT.

Results

Clear summaries generated for non-
technical users with 85%+ satisfaction.
Key model traits (e.g. hallucination risk,
domain fit) were understandable.
BERTopic improved clustering of LLMs by
use-case and style.
