Research Objectives/Goals

* Create a centralized research “radar” that continuously updates with new LLMs, architectures,
trends etc.

« Provide domain-specific model recommendations based on task type (e.g. risk forecasting,
sentiment analysis).

¢ Build a user-friendly explainer system for non-technical users in finance and business.

Research Methodology & Structure
¢ Exp 1: Radar
¢ ???Use web scraping, APIs (e.g., HuggingFace, arXiv) to detect emerging LLMs and architectures.
¢ ???Apply NLP + topic modeling (e.g., BERTopic) and time-series analysis to categorize models by task, size, domain,
and trend over time.
¢ Exp 1: Advisor
¢ ????Match user-defined tasks (e.g., “summarize earnings call”) with LLMs using task embeddings, similarity scores, or
a use-case Classifier.
????integrate benchmark scores and prompt templates to justify recommendations and guide fine-tuning or
deployment.
¢ Exp 1: Explainer
¢ ???Generate plain-language summaries using LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to explain technical concepts
¢ ????Visualize model differences and risks (e.g., hallucination rate, latency, cost)
