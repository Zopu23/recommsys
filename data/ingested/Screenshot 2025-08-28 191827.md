Exp 3: Explainer Module

Goal
=" Make LLM concepts, outputs, or decisions
understandable to non-technical users in finance.

Challenges

= Many Al terms (like fine-tuning, embeddings, overfitting, hallucination) are unfamiliar
to non-tech users.
Also, explaining why a model was recommended or how an LLM arrived at an answer
is hard as we get into Al explainability.

Possible Techniques
Glossary-Base Retrieval (curated glossary of Al/LLM terms and their plain-language
definitions)
LLM Explanation (Prompting): (utilize a large language model (maybe the same one
behind Advisor, or a smaller one) to generate explanations on demand)
Fine-Tuned Explainer Model (fine-tune a smaller open-source model to be an
“explainer”)
