Research Motivations

Â¢ Absence of monitoring tools for LLMs evolution
Currently, no tool exists to quantify or visualize the evolution of LLMs ina
finance-specific context, making it difficult for practitioners to identify relevant
trends or select suitable models.
Critical knowledge gap between financial experts and LLM technologies as
most finance professionals lack awareness of how current models perform,
evolve, or align with use-case-specific demands.
* Opportunity to build scalable, smart financial infrastructure in the future

Scope

This project proposes building an intelligence platform that tracks new LLMs,
recommends optimal models for financial tasks, and explains complex techniques
in plain language - all in one unified system.
