Project Materials & Discussion Ahead of Sunday
Hello everyone,

I've shared a few articles below that are relevant to our project - they're worth
skimming through for some background. I've also attached the draft slides (Power-
Point) I'll be presenting on Sunday.

Please note that our project idea is still very fresh. We haven't had the time yet to
conduct in-depth research or fully shape the final direction. The slides are just a rough
outline to help guide our discussion.

What we'd really love to talk about is whether you might be able to support us in
designing the system or help us identify or select the right tools for the recommender
modules.

Thanks so much for your understanding. I'm really looking forward to speaking with

Best regards,
