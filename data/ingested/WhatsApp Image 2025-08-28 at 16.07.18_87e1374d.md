Hi all,

Sharing some details to consider. I've also mocked an example, but it would be great if we could make it better and also ensure a more relevant
filtering.

Project Brief: LLM Tech Tracker App
Objective

Develop a lightweight application that aggregates and tracks the latest developments in Large Language Model (LLM) technologies. The app should
make it easy for users to discover new research papers, blogs, and repositories, with a focus on simplicity, portability, and ease of use.

Core Features

Feed Aggregation: Collect content from predefined RSS/Atom feeds (e.g., arXiv, Hugging Face, Google Al, Cohere, etc). Users should be
able to add or remove feeds.

Search & Filtering: Provide search across all feed content. Enable filtering by type (papers, blogs, repositories) and by keywords.

Keyword Tracking: Allow users to define keywords (e.g., “RAG”, “distillation”). Items containing these keywords are highlighted.

Reading Management: Users can mark items as read/unread, with preferences saved locally.

Sorting & Display: Support sorting by date (newest/oldest). Allow toggling of content summaries and show “time since publication.’

Persistence: Save feeds, preferences, and read/unread status so they remain available between sessions.
Technical Requirements
Should be built with a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React or Vue).

« Aim for a clean, maintainable codebase that is easy to extend.
