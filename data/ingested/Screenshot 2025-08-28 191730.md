Exp 1: Radar Module

Goal:

=" Continuously monitor the flood of new LLMs,
techniques, and trends, especially those relevant to
finance, and classify them in a useful way

Challenges:
=" The LLM landscape evolves rapidly -new models are
released almost daily, each with unique capabilities.

Possible Techniques

1. Automated Feed & Database (pipeline to scrape or query sources of LLM
announcements)

2. LLM/NLP-Based Classification (to classify new models and techniques). (Eg use of BERT-
based classifier/ChatGPT)

3. (Optional: Trend Analytics (Popularity Tracking): track which models are trending)
