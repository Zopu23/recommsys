Research Plan

1. Literature & Background Review
Goal: Gain deep understanding & context

2. Identify the right Tools 3. Start designing and building the
Goal: Find best tools & methods for system modules system

Summarize main points, techniques used, research gaps,
and open questions (structured summary table clearly
showing what’s already known and what’s missing
(justifying your project clearly).

4. Experiments and Technical
Evaluation
