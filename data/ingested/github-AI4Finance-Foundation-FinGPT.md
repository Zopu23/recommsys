FinGPT: Powering the Future of Finance with 20 Cutting-Edge Applications
Why FinGPT?
1). Finance is highly dynamic.
BloombergGPT
trained an LLM using a mixture of finance data and general-purpose data, which took about 53 days, at a cost of around
$3M
). It is costly to retrain an LLM model like BloombergGPT every month or every week, thus lightweight adaptation is highly favorable. FinGPT can be fine-tuned swiftly to incorporate new data (the cost falls significantly, less than
$300 per fine-tuning
).
2). Democratizing Internet-scale financial data is critical, say allowing timely updates of the model (monthly or weekly updates) using an automatic data curation pipeline.  BloombergGPT has privileged data access and APIs, while FinGPT presents a more accessible alternative. It prioritizes lightweight adaptation, leveraging the best available open-source LLMs.
3). The key technology is "RLHF (Reinforcement learning from human feedback)", which is missing in BloombergGPT. RLHF enables an LLM model to learn individual preferences (risk-aversion level, investing habits, personalized robo-advisor, etc.), which is the "secret" ingredient of ChatGPT and GPT4.
Milestone of AI Robo-Advisor: FinGPT-Forecaster
Try the latest released FinGPT-Forecaster demo at our
HuggingFace Space
The dataset for FinGPT-Forecaster:
https://huggingface.co/datasets/FinGPT/fingpt-forecaster-dow30-202305-202405
Enter the following inputs:
ticker symbol (e.g. AAPL, MSFT, NVDA)
the day from which you want the prediction to happen (yyyy-mm-dd)
the number of past weeks where market news are retrieved
whether to add the latest basic financials as additional information
Click SubmitÔºÅ And you'll be responded with a well-rounded analysis of the company and a prediction for next week's stock price movement!

FinGPT Demos:
Current State-of-the-arts for Financial Sentiment Analysis
FinGPT V3 (Updated on 10/12/2023)
What's new:
Best trainable and inferable FinGPT for sentiment analysis on a single RTX 3090, which is even better than GPT-4 and ChatGPT Finetuning.
FinGPT v3
series are LLMs finetuned with the LoRA method on the News and Tweets sentiment analysis dataset which achieve the best scores on most of the financial sentiment analysis datasets with low cost.
FinGPT v3.3 use llama2-13b as base model; FinGPT v3.2 uses llama2-7b as base model; FinGPT v3.1 uses chatglm2-6B as base model.

Cost per GPU hour.
For
A100 GPUs
, the AWS p4d.24xlarge instance, equipped with 8 A100 GPUs is used as a benchmark to estimate the costs. Note that BloombergGPT also used p4d.24xlarge As of July 11, 2023, the hourly rate for this instance stands at $32.773. Consequently, the estimated cost per GPU hour comes to $32.77 divided by 8, resulting in approximately
$4.10
. With this value as the reference unit price (1 GPU hour).
BloombergGPT estimated cost= 512 x 53 x 24 = 651,264 GPU hours x $4.10 = $2,670,182.40
. For
RTX 3090
, we assume its cost per hour is approximately
$1.0
, which is actually much higher than available GPUs from platforms like vast.ai.
Reproduce the results by running
benchmarks
, and the detailed tutorial is on the way.

FinGPT Ecosystem
FinGPT embraces a full-stack framework for FinLLMs with five layers:
Data source layer
: This layer assures comprehensive market coverage, addressing the temporal sensitivity of financial data through real-time information capture.
Data engineering layer
: Primed for real-time NLP data processing, this layer tackles the inherent challenges of high temporal sensitivity and low signal-to-noise ratio in financial data.
LLMs layer
: Focusing on a range of fine-tuning methodologies such as LoRA, this layer mitigates the highly dynamic nature of financial data, ensuring the model‚Äôs relevance and accuracy.
Task layer
: This layer is responsible for executing fundamental tasks. These tasks serve as the benchmarks for performance evaluations and cross-comparisons in the realm of FinLLMs
Application layer
: Showcasing practical applications and demos, this layer highlights the potential capability of FinGPT in the financial sector.
FinGPT Framework: Open-Source Financial Large Language Models
FinGPT-RAG
: We present a retrieval-augmented large language model framework specifically designed for financial sentiment analysis, optimizing information depth and context through external knowledge retrieval, thereby ensuring nuanced predictions.
FinGPT-FinNLP
: FinNLP provides a playground for all people interested in LLMs and NLP in Finance. Here we provide full pipelines for LLM training and finetuning in the field of finance. The full architecture is shown in the following picture. Detail codes and introductions can be found
here
. Or you may refer to the
wiki
FinGPT-Benchmark
: We introduce a novel Instruction Tuning paradigm optimized for open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) in finance, enhancing their adaptability to diverse financial datasets while also facilitating cost-effective, systematic benchmarking from task-specific, multi-task, and zero-shot instruction tuning tasks.
